# Visualizing Sorting Algorithms

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Current thoughts are:

- single page app with a few components:
- component where we can choose from a few sorting options (we can start with a bubble sort, then try a few we're interested in).
-a component where we can enter data (we might want to start with test data)
- a component that contains each step of the sorting algorith from initial unsorted to fully sorted.
  - Each of those steps will most likely be components themselves.
